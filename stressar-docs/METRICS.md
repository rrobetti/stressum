This document describes every metric Stressar collects, the mechanism used to
collect it, the output file it appears in, and how to interpret it across JDBC
workload stress tests.

## 1. Measurement Scope

The latency clock covers **everything the application sees**: connection
acquisition from the pool _plus_ the full SQL round-trip, including result-set
consumption.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Worker Thread
    participant CP as ConnectionProvider
    participant DB as PostgreSQL / OJP Proxy

    W->>W: t₀ = System.nanoTime()
    W->>CP: getConnection()
    CP-->>W: connection
    W->>DB: executeQuery()
    DB-->>W: ResultSet
    W->>W: rs.next() (consume rows)
    W->>W: t₁ = System.nanoTime()
    Note over W: latencyNanos = t₁ − t₀
```

Source: `LoadGenerator.executeWorkload()` in `src/main/java/com/bench/load/LoadGenerator.java`.

**What is included:** connection-pool wait, TCP round-trip to DB or proxy, query
execution on PostgreSQL, result-set transmission and iteration.

**What is excluded:** JVM scheduling jitter between the dispatcher thread
submitting the task and the worker thread starting it. This overhead is captured
separately as the _scheduling delay_ metric (see §4).

There are **two** `MetricsCollector` instances running in parallel inside each bench JVM:

| Collector                    | Purpose                                                                   | Reset cadence               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `metrics` (cumulative)       | Tracks totals from warmup-reset onwards; used for `summary.json`.         | After warmup phase.         |
| `intervalMetrics` (interval) | Tracks per-sampling-window values; used for `timeseries.csv` percentiles. | After every row is written. |

Using a per-interval histogram guarantees that `p99` in row _N_ of the CSV reflects
only requests completed in that specific second, not a diluted value across the whole
run. The cumulative histogram in `hdr.hlog` represents the entire steady-state phase.

The sampling interval is controlled by `metricsIntervalSeconds` (default: **1 second**).

Source: `BenchmarkRunner.java`, lines 80–133.

## 3. Output Files

### timeseries.csv

Written in real-time during the **steady-state phase only** (warmup and cooldown
are excluded).

| Column          | Unit         | Source                                 |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp_iso` | ISO 8601 UTC | Wall clock at time of snapshot         |
| `attempted_rps` | req/s        | Δ(attempted) ÷ Δt since last row       |
| `achieved_rps`  | req/s        | Δ(completed) ÷ Δt since last row       |
| `errors`        | count        | Δ(errors) in this interval             |
| `p50_ms`        | ms           | HdrHistogram p50 — **interval only**   |
| `p95_ms`        | ms           | HdrHistogram p95 — **interval only**   |
| `p99_ms`        | ms           | HdrHistogram p99 — **interval only**   |
| `p999_ms`       | ms           | HdrHistogram p99.9 — **interval only** |
| `max_ms`        | ms           | HdrHistogram max — **interval only**   |

> Percentiles are derived from the **per-interval histogram** that is reset after
> every row. This prevents percentiles from converging toward a run-average over
> time and allows transient spikes to be visible.

File size: ≈ 100–150 bytes/row → ≈ 60–90 KB for a 600 s run per instance.

---

### summary.json

Written once at the end of each `bench run` invocation. Contains the aggregate
view of the entire steady-state phase (warmup excluded, cooldown included up to
the moment the load generator is stopped).

Key fields:

```
runInfo                         — run context (SUT, workload, instance ID, …)
attemptedRps                    — mean attempted RPS over the measurement window
achievedThroughputRps           — backward-compatible alias of successfulThroughputRps
successfulThroughputRps         — mean successful RPS over the measurement window
errorThroughputRps              — mean failed-request RPS over the measurement window
totalThroughputRps              — mean total completed RPS (successful + failed)
errorRate                       — failedRequests / (completedRequests + failedRequests)
latencyMs.{p50,p95,p99,p999,max,mean,meanSuccessful,meanFailed,meanTotal}  — cumulative latency stats
errorsByType.{<ExceptionClassSimpleName>: count, ...}  — error breakdown
appCpuMedian                    — median application CPU % (optional)
appRssMedian                    — median resident set size in MB (optional)
gcPauseMsTotal                  — total JVM GC pause time in ms (optional)
dbActiveConnectionsMedian       — median active backend connections (optional)
queueDepthMax                   — peak connection-pool queue depth (optional)
```

**Open-loop–specific fields** (present when `openLoop: true`):

```
runInfo.openLoopAttemptedOps         — total operations submitted by dispatcher
runInfo.openLoopMissedOpportunities  — send slots skipped because system fell behind
runInfo.openLoopSchedulingDelayMs    — cumulative dispatcher scheduling delay in ms
```

**OJP-specific fields** (present when `connectionMode: OJP`):

```
runInfo.clientPooling                          — always "none" (server-side pooling)
runInfo.ojpVirtualConnectionMode               — PER_WORKER or PER_OPERATION
runInfo.ojpPoolSharing                         — PER_INSTANCE or SHARED
runInfo.clientVirtualConnectionsOpenedTotal    — total virtual connections opened
runInfo.clientVirtualConnectionsMaxConcurrent  — peak concurrent virtual connections
```

Source: `SummaryWriter.java`, `MetricsSnapshot.java`.

---

### hdr.hlog

An HdrHistogram log file covering the entire steady-state phase. Values are stored
in **microseconds** (1 µs resolution, 3 significant digits).

The file can be analysed offline with standard HdrHistogram tooling:

```bash
# View percentile distribution using the HdrHistogram log processor
java -jar HdrHistogram-2.1.12.jar -i results/run-1/hdr.hlog -outputValueUnitRatio 1000

# Or using the online viewer at https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html
```

For multi-replica runs, `HistogramAggregator` merges histograms by **adding
counts** (not averaging percentiles), which is the statistically correct way to
combine independent histograms.

Source: `LatencyRecorder.exportToLog()`, `HistogramAggregator.java`.

## 4. Metric Catalogue — Bench Client (Currently Collected)

### Latency metrics

| Metric             | Description                                                              | Collection method                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **p50** (median)   | Half of all requests finish faster than this.                            | `HdrHistogram.getValueAtPercentile(50.0)`                            |
| **p95**            | 95 % of requests finish faster. Primary latency SLO threshold (default < 10 s for mixed OLTP + OLAP workloads). | `HdrHistogram.getValueAtPercentile(95.0)`                            |
| **p99**            | 99 % of requests finish faster. Indicates tail behaviour.                | `HdrHistogram.getValueAtPercentile(99.0)`                            |
| **p99.9**          | 99.9 % of requests finish faster. Captures extreme outliers.             | `HdrHistogram.getValueAtPercentile(99.9)`                            |
| **max**            | Worst single latency observed.                                           | `HdrHistogram.getMaxValue()`                                         |
| **meanSuccessful** | Arithmetic mean for successful requests only.                            | `HdrHistogram.getMean()`                                             |
| **meanFailed**     | Arithmetic mean for failed requests only.                                | `sum(failedLatencyNanos) / failedRequests`                           |
| **meanTotal**      | Arithmetic mean across successful + failed requests.                     | `(sum(successLatencyNanos)+sum(failedLatencyNanos)) / totalRequests` |
| **mean**           | Backward-compatible alias for `meanTotal`.                               | same as `meanTotal`                                                  |

All latency values are reported in **milliseconds** in the output files. The
histogram stores values internally in **microseconds** for precision.

The highest trackable latency is **60,000 ms** (60 seconds). Any latency
exceeding this is clamped to the maximum bucket. Values this large indicate a
completely saturated system; normal operating range is well below 1 second.

### Throughput metrics

| Metric                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attempted_rps`           | Rate at which the dispatcher submitted operations to the worker pool. For open-loop runs this equals `targetRps` under normal conditions; it drops when the dispatcher itself is CPU-limited. |
| `successfulThroughputRps` | Successful requests per second.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `errorThroughputRps`      | Failed requests per second.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `totalThroughputRps`      | Completed requests per second (`successfulThroughputRps + errorThroughputRps`).                                                                                                               |
| `achievedThroughputRps`   | Backward-compatible alias of `successfulThroughputRps`.                                                                                                                                       |
| `errorRate`               | `failedRequests ÷ (completedRequests + failedRequests)`. SLO threshold: < 0.001 (0.1 %).                                                                                                      |

---

### Error metrics

Errors are classified by the Java exception type caught in `LoadGenerator.executeWorkload()`:

| Key                          | Meaning                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<ExceptionClassSimpleName>` | Java exception class simple name (for example `SQLTimeoutException`, `PSQLException`, `IllegalStateException`) |

All exceptions are grouped and counted by exception class type only (not by message). Each key appears in `summary.json` under `errorsByType`.

---

### Open-loop correctness metrics

These fields appear in `summary.json > runInfo` when `openLoop: true`.

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openLoopAttemptedOps`        | Total send-slots the dispatcher processed.                                                                                                                             |
| `openLoopMissedOpportunities` | Send-slots skipped because `System.nanoTime()` was already past the scheduled send time by more than one interval. A non-zero value means the system is over capacity. |
| `openLoopSchedulingDelayMs`   | Cumulative sum of how many nanoseconds late each dispatch was (divided by 1,000,000 for ms). Captures OS and JVM scheduling jitter.                                    |

The dispatcher uses **absolute time-based scheduling** (`nextSendTimeNanos += intervalNanos`).
When the system falls behind, it records the delay and moves forward — it never
issues a burst of catch-up requests. This is critical for correct open-loop
measurement.

### OJP-specific metrics

| Field                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clientVirtualConnectionsOpenedTotal`   | Total number of virtual JDBC connections opened from this bench instance to the OJP server during the run. High values in `PER_OPERATION` mode indicate connection churn. |
| `clientVirtualConnectionsMaxConcurrent` | Peak number of virtual connections held open simultaneously.                                                                                                              |
| `ojpVirtualConnectionMode`              | `PER_WORKER`: one virtual connection per worker thread (low churn). `PER_OPERATION`: open/close per SQL operation (tests connection setup overhead).                      |
| `ojpPoolSharing`                        | `PER_INSTANCE`: each bench JVM gets its own server-side pool (size = `dbConnectionBudget`). `SHARED`: all replicas share one pool (size = `dbConnectionBudget` total).    |

Source: `OjpProvider.java`, `BenchmarkRunner.java`.

## 5. Node-Level Metrics — Collection

The bench client (§4) measures what the _application sees_. The following
metrics are also collected automatically during a run:

```mermaid

    subgraph Control ["Control Node — in-process (bench JVM)"]
        direction LR
        CPU["appCpuMedian\nOperatingSystemMXBean\n.getProcessCpuLoad()"]

    end

```

### Bench / control node (in-process)

These metrics are collected **inside the bench JVM** by `SystemMetricsCollector`
during the steady-state phase only (started after warmup-reset, stopped before
the final snapshot). Results appear in `summary.json` for every replica.

| Field in `summary.json` | Metric                                               | Source                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appCpuMedian`          | Median process CPU load (%) during steady-state      | `com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.getProcessCpuLoad()`, sampled every 5 s |
| `gcPauseMsTotal`        | Total GC pause time (ms) accrued during steady-state | `GarbageCollectorMXBean.getCollectionTime()` delta from steady-state start to end |

Source: `SystemMetricsCollector.java`, wired into `BenchmarkRunner.java`.

---

### CPU metric scopes used in `report.md`

To avoid scope confusion, CPU metrics are reported in three explicit scopes:

- `bench_jvm_cpu` — in-process bench JVM CPU (`appCpuMedian` from `summary.json`).
- `service_cpu` — CPU for the sampled service process tree (`cpu_pct` from `*_proc_metrics.csv`).
- `host_cpu` — host-level CPU busy in core-percent (`host_cpu_pct` from `*_proc_metrics.csv`, `/proc/stat`; 100% = 1 CPU, max ~= NCPU×100).

For proxy tiers, `aligned_peak` is computed as `max_t(sum cpu_pct at timestamp t)` across nodes.
The report also shows `legacy_peak_sum` (sum of each node peak) for backward comparability.

All side-car derived CPU/RSS metrics are restricted to the benchmark steady-state window.

---

### OJP proxy node — JVM heap vs OS RSS

> ⚠️ **Critical distinction for OJP:** Java acquires memory from the OS and
> does **not** return it after GC, so OS RSS (as reported by `ps`/`top`)
> significantly overstates actual memory in use.
> A process showing 2 GB RSS may have only 400 MB of live heap objects.
>
> **`collect_jvm_metrics.sh` uses `jstat -gc`, NOT OS RSS,** to measure actual heap.

The `run_benchmarks_ojp.yml` playbook deploys `ansible/scripts/collect_jvm_metrics.sh`
to each proxy node, starts it in the background before bench replicas begin, stops
it after all replicas finish, and fetches the resulting CSV to
`results/<run_name>/node_metrics/proxy/<host>_jvm_metrics.csv`.

| Column in `_jvm_metrics.csv` | Metric                                    | Formula                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `heap_used_mb`               | Actual in-use heap (MB)                   | `(S0U + S1U + EU + OU) / 1024` from `jstat -gc` |
| `heap_committed_mb`          | Committed heap capacity (MB)              | `(S0C + S1C + EC + OC) / 1024` from `jstat -gc` |

### PostgreSQL DB node

The `run_benchmarks_ojp.yml` playbook deploys `ansible/scripts/collect_pg_metrics.sh`
to the DB node, starts it before bench replicas, stops it after, and fetches the
CSV to `results/<run_name>/node_metrics/pg_metrics.csv`. PostgreSQL statistics are
reset with `pg_stat_reset()` + `pg_stat_reset_shared('bgwriter')` before each run
to give clean per-run deltas.

| Column in `pg_metrics.csv` | Source view / column       | Why it matters                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `numbackends`              | `pg_stat_database`         | Active backend connections; median reported in report                     |
| `xact_commit`              | `pg_stat_database`         | Cumulative committed transactions; cross-check vs bench RPS               |
| `xact_rollback`            | `pg_stat_database`         | Non-zero → contention or application errors                               |
| `blks_hit` / `blks_read`   | `pg_stat_database`         | Used to compute cache hit ratio                                           |
| `cache_hit_pct`            | computed                   | `blks_hit / (blks_hit + blks_read) × 100`; < 99 % → tune `shared_buffers` |
| `temp_bytes`               | `pg_stat_database`         | Non-zero → sort/hash spills; tune `work_mem`                              |
| `deadlocks`                | `pg_stat_database`         | Should be 0 for OLTP workloads                                            |
| `lock_waits`               | `pg_locks` (instantaneous) | Count of ungranted locks; > 0 → hot-row contention                        |
| `buffers_checkpoint`       | `pg_stat_bgwriter`         | Buffers written by checkpointer; high → WAL/I/O pressure                  |
| `checkpoint_write_ms`      | `pg_stat_bgwriter`         | Cumulative ms spent writing during checkpoints; high → I/O-bound          |

## 6. Workload Operations

The SQL executed by each workload type:

### W1_READ_ONLY

| Mix          | SQL                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 30 % Query A | `SELECT account_id, username, email, full_name, balance_cents, status FROM accounts WHERE account_id = ?`                         |
| 70 % Query B | `SELECT order_id, account_id, created_at, status, total_cents FROM orders WHERE account_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20` |

Each operation opens **one connection** from the pool, executes **one** prepared
statement, and closes the connection.

### W2_READ_WRITE (and W2_MIXED)

The write path is a three-statement **explicit transaction**:

1. `INSERT INTO orders(account_id, created_at, status, total_cents) VALUES (?, ?, 0, 0) RETURNING order_id`
2. `INSERT INTO order_lines(order_id, line_no, item_id, qty, price_cents) SELECT …` — repeated 1–4 times (uniform random)
3. `UPDATE orders SET total_cents = (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(qty * price_cents), …)) WHERE order_id = ?`

`W2_MIXED` mixes W1 reads with W2_READ_WRITE writes at a configurable ratio
(default 80 % read / 20 % write, controlled by `writePercent`).

The **latency clock covers the entire transaction** including the commit.

### W3_SLOW_QUERY

| Mix            | SQL                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 99 % fast path | Same as W1 Query B                                                                                                                           |
| 1 % slow path  | `SELECT … FROM orders o JOIN order_lines ol … WHERE o.created_at > (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '90 days') GROUP BY … ORDER BY … LIMIT 500` |

The slow query is a full JOIN + GROUP BY + ORDER BY on the last 90 days of orders.
This workload is used to evaluate how the proxy tier handles queries of mixed
duration (head-of-line blocking, server-side pool starvation under slow queries).

## 7. Environment Snapshot

Running `bench env-snapshot` captures a point-in-time snapshot of the control
node's environment into `results/env/<timestamp>/`:

| File            | Contents                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `snapshot.json` | Machine-readable: OS family/version, CPU model/cores/frequency, total RAM, Java version/vendor/JVM flags, Git commit + branch + dirty flag, dependency versions.              |
| `snapshot.md`   | Human-readable Markdown version of the same data, with placeholder sections for PostgreSQL `postgresql.conf` and PgBouncer `pgbouncer.ini` settings to be filled in manually. |

The snapshot is used for reproducibility: attach it to every published benchmark
result so readers can verify the hardware and software baseline.

Source: `EnvSnapshotCommand.java` (uses [OSHI](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) for
hardware detection).

## 8. Multi-Replica Aggregation

When 16 bench JVM replicas run in parallel, each writes its own
`instance_N/summary.json` and `instance_N/hdr.hlog`. Running `bench aggregate`
or `ansible/scripts/generate_report.sh` combines them.

**Correct aggregation for histograms:**
`HistogramAggregator.aggregateHistogramLogs()` merges HDR logs by **adding
histogram bucket counts**. This preserves the true combined distribution. Do not
average percentiles across replicas; that is statistically incorrect.

**Throughput aggregation:**
Total aggregate RPS = sum of `achievedThroughputRps` across all instances.
`generate_report.sh` reports both per-instance mean and aggregate total.

Source: `HistogramAggregator.java`, `ansible/scripts/generate_report.sh`.

## 9. Limitations and Known Issues

| #   | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Impact                                                                                                           |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Latency clock starts at actual send, not scheduled time.** The gap between when the dispatcher submitted a task and when the worker thread actually started it is not included in the per-operation latency. This gap is tracked as `openLoopSchedulingDelayMs` in aggregate but not per-operation. | Reported latencies may understate end-to-end response time under heavy contention for worker threads.            |
| 2   | **No cross-replica clock synchronisation.** Each bench JVM uses its own `System.currentTimeMillis()` for `timestamp_iso`. Merging timeseries from different machines assumes clocks are within NTP-synchronised bounds (≤ 10 ms drift).                                                               | Timeseries from LG-1 and LG-2 may have small timestamp offsets.                                                  |
| 3   | **`appRssMedian` schema field is not populated and misleading for OJP.** Java holds memory from the OS after GC; OS RSS overstates live heap. The field is retained in the schema for non-JVM SUTs. For OJP, use `heap_used_mb` from the `jstat` side-car CSV (§5).                                   | RSS would have been 2–5× the actual live heap for OJP.                                                           |
| 4   | **OJP server-side pool occupancy and queue depth not yet collected.** These require OJP to expose a management API or JMX MBean.                                                                                                                                                                      | Cannot directly observe server-side back-pressure without OJP instrumentation.                                   |
| 5   | **HDR histogram highest trackable value is 60 s.** Latencies above 60,000 ms are clamped to the max bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Extremely high tail values during catastrophic saturation are reported as 60,000 ms instead of their true value. |
